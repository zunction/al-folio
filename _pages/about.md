Hi I'm Zhangsheng (pronounced "zunction" hence my GitHub account handle) and ÈïøÁõõ in Chinese. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Singapore University of Technology and Design in [Prof. Dr. Ernest Chong's](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~ernest_chong/index.html) team. I had my undergraduate training in mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and upon graduation I worked as a lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic as a mathematics lecturer. Three years into the job, I decided I wanted to further grow and do more with  my mathematical knowledge and thus embarked on a graduate program. 

My PhD was generously supported by the Economic Development Board (EDB) Industrial Postgraduate Programme (2016/20), advised by [Dr Shaowei Lin](https://shaoweilin.github.io/) in collaboration with NVIDIA Singapore. My thesis, "Dependent Types, Canonical Structures and Reflection Strategies for Assisted Reasoning and Computation on Knowledge Graphs" investigates how we can build machines with reasoning capabilities to assist humans. Particularly, we look to [dependent type theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+type+theory) implemented in the proof assistant [COQ](https://coq.inria.fr/) for assisted writing of formally verified algorithms used for querying knowledge graphs. I also have an interest in category theory, especially the [Yoneda lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_lemma), which you can read from this excellent [blog post](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-yoneda-perspective), that it says: all vantage points give all information. This is evident when we look at the knowledge graph, a resource (node) is characterised by not its name, but the relations (edges) that it has with other resources.


In my free time outside of research, I can be found working on my mobility and flexibility as a newbie at yoga üôè, or training my swings at the golf range ‚õ≥ , or trying my best not to fall at the ice skating rink ‚ùÑÔ∏è.
