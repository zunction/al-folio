My PhD advisor, Dr Shaowei Lin is giving a talk at the [topos institute colloquium](https://topos.site/topos-colloquium/) with the abstract of his talk below:

Abstract

The Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs suggests that we can exploit proof assistants for writing software. I will discuss the challenges behind a na√Øve execution of this idea, and some preliminary strategies for overcoming them. As an example, we will organize higher-order information in knowledge graphs using dependent type theory, and automate the answering of queries using a proof assistant. In another example, we will explore how decentralized proof assistants can enable mathematicians or programmers to work collaboratively on a theorem or application. If time permits, I will outline connections to canonical structures, reflection (ssreflect), transport, unification and universe management.
