My friend Jin Xing has released his work on the formalization of divide and conquer strategy! 

In his formalization of the divide and conquer strategy in the Coq proof assistant, he illustrates the importance of this strategy using sorting algorithms.

Sorting algorithms used in many places. For example on an e-commerce platform a customer like me and you sort the products by pricing to find the what you want for the best value. The sorting speed is important, as there is often many products to sort, and if the sorting takes a very long time, the customer might lose interest and not make a purchase. Thus an time efficient sorting algorithm like *merge sort* which uses the divided and conquer strategy is needed (read more [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-vs-insertion-sort/)).

Head over to [his page](https://github.com/jinxing1990/coq-formalized-divide-and-conquer) where he explains his work with his implementation available if you wanna know more!
