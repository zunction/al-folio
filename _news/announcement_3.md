My friend Jin Xing has released his work on the formalization of divide and conquer strategy! His formalization is done in the Coq proof assistant with illustrations of his work using sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms used in many places, for example when shopping on an e-commerce platform we sort the products by pricing to get the best bang for your buck. There might be many products to sort, if the sorting takes a very long time the customer might lose interest and not purchase the product. Thus sorting speed is important, with *merge sort* more efficient than *insertion sort* in terms of time (read more [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-vs-insertion-sort/)). The merge sort algorithm is based on the divide and conquer strategy. Head over to [his page](https://github.com/jinxing1990/coq-formalized-divide-and-conquer) where he explains his work with his implementation available if you wanna know more!
