My friend Jin Xing has released his work on the formalization of divide and conquer strategy! 

In his formalization of the divide and conquer strategy in the Coq proof assistant, he illustrates the importance of this strategy using sorting algorithms.

Sorting algorithms used in many places. For example on an e-commerce platform a customer often sorts the products by their prices to find out which product provides the best value. Thus the sorting speed is important, as there are often many products to sort, and when the sorting takes too long, the customer might lose interest and not make a purchase. A time efficient sorting algorithm like *merge sort* which uses the divided and conquer strategy is needed (read more [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-vs-insertion-sort/)) to make sure that the sorting is performed in a reasonable time.

Head over to [his page](https://github.com/jinxing1990/coq-formalized-divide-and-conquer) where he explains his work if you are interested to know more!
